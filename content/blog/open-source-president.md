# Dear Leader

Open Source software needs a president.

The main problem is currently that we are stuck with old software that we cant fix.

Apple often just says whatever and changes things: Arm, Metal

Zig and Linux are run very well and they both have presidents.

The web is the main example

More of a dal li lama than a president
